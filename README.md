# Yellowstone Lake Analysis

This repository contains Python scripts for analyzing the morphotrophication of all lakes within Yellowstone National Park. The analysis uses **Vollen** and **Carlson** measurement methods to classify and visualize lake data, with automated graph generation for statistical comparisons.

## Project Overview

The research focuses on understanding the trophic state of lakes in Yellowstone using both Carlson's Trophic State Index (TSI) and the Vollen method. These scripts help visualize and compare the morphotrophication data across different lakes, providing valuable insights into the ecological status of the parkâ€™s water bodies.

### Scripts Included:

- **Carlson_alone 1.py** - Analysis script for applying Carlson's method to the dataset.
- **Inlet_vs_Inlake_phosphorus.py** - Compares phosphorus levels in lake inlets vs. in-lake measurements.
- **Tetons_Carlson_Classification.py** - Classification and graph generation based on Carlson's TSI for lakes in the Tetons.
- **Tetons_Vollen_Classification.py** - Classification and graph generation using the Vollen method for Tetons lakes.
- **YellowstoneLakesData-reformatted.csv** - Reformatted dataset containing information for all lakes.

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/taylormiskin/Yellowstone-Lake-Analysis.git
